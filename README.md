## Sky recognition

To play with the images, we are using [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

In [SkyRecognition](https://github.com/met-office-lab/traffic-cam-python/tree/master/SkyRecognition), you can find a [set of images](https://github.com/met-office-lab/traffic-cam-python/tree/master/SkyRecognition/Images) and an _[.ipynb file](https://github.com/met-office-lab/traffic-cam-python/blob/master/SkyRecognition/SkyRecognition.ipynb)_.

To run that file, you have to put the images you want to use in your __Downloads__ folder.

This basic code just display an image, with what you can consider as the sky in black colour. Moreover, you can display the colour composition of the image.

__NEXT STEP:__

__What could be done is to display the graph of the part of the image you consider as the sky.__

__Then, you should try to characterize the type of weather you can see on the image.__
