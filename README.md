## Sky recognition

To play with the images, we are using Python and the Jupyter Notebook.

In SkyRecognition, you can find a set of images and an .ipynb file.

To run that file, you have to put the images you want to use in your Downloads folder.

This basic code just display an image, with what you can consider as the sky in black colour. Moreover, you can display the colour composition of your image.

__NEXT STEP:__

__What could be done is to display the graph for the part of the image you consider as the sky.__

__Then, you should try to characterize the type of weather you can see on the image.__
